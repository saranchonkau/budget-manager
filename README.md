# budget-manager
Budget manager is my pet project which is aimed to solve my pain with expenses management.
Also I'm going to experiment with different technologies during development

The project has monorepo structure. I've chosen `yarn v1` as package manager.

## Backend
For backend I use `node.js` without any framework. I'm trying to build well architectured app using DDD principles and Onion architecture. Also to handle exceptions I use `Either` monad. It's really good approach.
